# C-Enc

C-Enc is a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating that the C programming language supports proper encapsulation.

*May Dennis Ritchie bless me, and let the great debate ensue.*

### ðŸ›  Build & Run Steps

1. **Prerequisites:** 
    - **Operating System:** Ensure you're on a proper operating system. UNIX-like systems such as Linux and macOS are preferred. As for you niche Windows OS enthusiasts... well, you know what you've gotten into.
    - **Compiler:** **`gcc`** is our weapon of choice (why? Because I said so!). If it hasn't already honored your system with its presence, perhaps it's time to invite it. And for our FreeBSD aficionados â€” don't fret; we duly tip our hats to clang.
2. **Build:**
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. **Run:**
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```
